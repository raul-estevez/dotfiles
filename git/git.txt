########################## INITIAL CONFIGURATION ##########################

For ease of use, I prefer to use SSH to clone & push files into GitHub. For this we will need to generate a public/private key pair and upload it to GitHub.

First we generate the key pair:
    $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key" just press enter, same with the passphrase.

Then we need to add the private key to the ssh agent of your SO:
    First start the agent:
        $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    The if you accepted the defaults in the last step just type:
        $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Then you need to add the public SSH key to your github account.

IMPORTANT: If you want to avoid typing your credentials every time you interact with github in a cloned repo, clone the repository usign SSH:
    $ git clone git@github.com:username/repo
